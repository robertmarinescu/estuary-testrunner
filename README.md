## Api docs
[4.0.1](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dinuta/estuary-testrunner/4.0.1)

## Postman collection
[Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2360061/SVYrrdGe)

## Use cases:
-  remote command executor through cli version. Any command can be executed, except "rm" like commands
-  testing: test execution, getting results ...

## Container support
-  mvn & java jdk  
-  make  
-  npm
-  other: you can use this image as base and install on top your dependencies 

## TestRunner service usage
1. use the service embedded in this container and mount your testing framework
2. build your absolute custom framework image and integrate this service as a self-contained application service (cli). Read [doc](https://github.com/dinuta/estuary-testrunner/wiki).

Use cases:
1. estuary-testrunner vs an external SUT / dockerized SUT
2. estuary-testrunner used inside docker-compose with estuary-deployer

## Service run
### Docker compose
    docker-compose up
    
### Docker run

    docker run  
    -d 
    -p 8080:8080
    dinutac/estuary-testrunner:<tag>
    
    
### Kubernetes
    kubectl apply -f k8sdeployment.yml
    
### Eureka registration
To have all your testrunner instances in a central location we use netflix eureka. This means your client will discover
all services used for your test and then spread the tests across all.

Start Eureka server with docker:

    docker run -p 8080:8080 netflixoss/eureka:1.3.1
    or
    docker run -p 8080:8080 dinutac/netflixoss-eureka:1.9.15

Start your containers by specifying the full hostname or ip of the host machine on where your testrunner service resides.
Optionally you can define the WORKSPACE (default=/tmp)or PORT (default=8080).

    docker run \
    -e EUREKA_SERVER=http://10.10.15.28:8080/eureka/v2 -> the eureka server
    -e APP_IP_PORT=10.10.15.28:8081 -> the ip and port of the app
    -e WORKSPACE=/tmp/ -> optional;for multiplatform set it to your needs;default is /tmp/;E.g /workspace/
    -p 8080:8080
    dinutac/estuary-testrunner:<tag>

### Fluentd logging
Please consult [Fluentd](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd) for logging setup.  
Estuary-testrunner tags all logs in format ```estuary-testrunner.**```

Matcher example:  

``` xml
<match estuary*.**>
    @type stdout
</match>
```

Run example:

    docker run \
    -e FLUENTD_IP_PORT=10.10.15.28:24224
    -p 8080:8080
    dinutac/estuary-testrunner:<tag>

### Authentication
For auth set HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN env variable.  

Run example:

    docker run \
    -e HTTP_AUTH_TOKEN=mysecret
    -p 8080:8080
    dinutac/estuary-testrunner:<tag>

Then, access the Http Api. Call example:
  
    curl -i -H 'Token:mysecret' http:localhost:8080/about
